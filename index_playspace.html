<h2 style="color:lightpink;"> Neighborhood: Upper West Side </h2>

<h3> <style="color:lightpink;"> By: Maryam Yaghoubi </h3>

<p style="color:white;"> <b> In the late 1950’s the area from 60th to 65th Streets between Amsterdam Avenue and the 11th Avenue railroad tracks, was San Juan Hill. It was largely an Afro-American and Puerto Rican neighborhood. San Juan Hill was one of the largest and poorest African-American neighborhoods in Manhattan before the rise of Harlem. It was at this time that the African-American population exodus to Harlem and a wave of Puerto Rican residents moved in. The gang activities and the poor conditions of the neighborhood inspired Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim write the West Side Story in the late 1950’s. In 1955 John D. Rockefeller 3rd, one of the principal contributors, began with funds for planning of Lincoln Center. </b> </p>

<p style="color:white;"> <b> In 1960 the construction of Lincoln Center as a large ‘urban renewal’ project led by Robert Moses resulted in some of the African Americans living in the area to be moved to the Amsterdam Housing Projects on the far West side; the rest were displaced completely. The neighborhood that once was the cradle of jazz in New York City had then disappeared (Jacoby, 2013). President Eisenhower dug the first shovel to commemorate the death of San Juan Hill and the birth of Lincoln Center. Consequently, a total of 40,000 people were displaced by the means of eviction as result of this large urban renewal project. Many of the changes during this time is essentially due to vision of one man with an immense political power who consequently changed the face of many neighborhoods in NYC. Robert Moses who “got things done”, I must add in very large scale, began to lose his reputation as the discussion around urban planning shifted towards a smaller scale approach to planning. The notion of neighborhoods and community planning then became a priority due to efforts of Jane Jacobs and her instrumental publications.  </b> </p>
